# Cassandra Journal Plugin for ZIO Actors Persistance

This plugin uses `quill-cassandra` as cql client to connect to the database.

The schema follows the akka-persistance standard to favor apps willing to migrate.

### Known issues
Because of the current limitations of `zio.actors.persistence.journal.Journal` plugins, we cannot configure custom serializers for our events.
For this reason, we decided to use `jackson` here.
Currently this forces us to declare nasty `@JsonTypeInfo` annotations on top of our event case classes.
Hopefully we can find a better workaround in the near future to provide a much cleaner and elegant api.
