## Summary
This plugin uses `quill-cassandra` as cql client to connect to the database.

The schema follows the [akka-persistance standard](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-cassandra/current/journal.html#schema) to favor apps willing to migrate.

Others can simply sit on top, or fork the project to fit their custom needs.

<hr/>

## sbt
Add the library to your project dependencies:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.github.prom3th3us" %% "zio-actors-cassandra-journal" % "<version>"
```

### ‚öîÔ∏è Known issues
Because of `zio.actors.persistence.journal.Journal` plugin limitations, we cannot configure custom serializers for our events.
For this reason, we decided to use `jackson` here. This forces us to declare nasty `@JsonTypeInfo` annotations on top of our event case classe for it to work, but it does the job quite good, fast and reliable.
