# Cassandra Journal Plugin for ZIO Actors Persistance

This plugin uses `quill-cassandra` as cql client to connect to the database.

The schema follows the akka-persistance standard to favor apps willing to migrate.

Others can simply sit on top, or fork the project to fit their custom needs.

<hr/>

### ‚öîÔ∏è Known issues
Because of `zio.actors.persistence.journal.Journal` plugin limitations, we cannot configure custom serializers for our events.
For this reason, we decided to use `jackson` here. This forces us to declare nasty `@JsonTypeInfo` annotations on top of our event case classe for it to work, but it does the job quite good, fast and reliable.
